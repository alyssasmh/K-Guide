# K Guide+
An app that was made as a collaborative project to educate others on Kik related Android &amp; Bot development on the platform using [Tomer's API](https://github.com/tomer8007/kik-bot-api-unofficial). Inspired by the guide apps created by Vince/Kinky and Rab a few years ago. 
This app was pretty far in development when we stopped working on it, like 75% completed. I don't plan to pick this back up anytime soon but if someone would like to use what we made so far and add onto it I can provide access to the app assets. 
The app was made mostly by myself, Stetho and Mint. Some of the information in certain sections of the app were planned to be revised and cleaned up with better/more information but ultimately didn't make it to fruition.
